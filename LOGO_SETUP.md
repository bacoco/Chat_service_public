# MiCha Logo Setup Instructions

To complete the logo integration, please follow these steps:

## 1. Save the Logo Files

Save the MiCha logo image in the following locations:

### Main Logo
- Save the full logo as: `extension/icons/micha-logo.png`

### Extension Icons
Create resized versions of just the speech bubble icon (without the "Micha" text) for the Chrome extension:

- `extension/icons/icon-16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `extension/icons/icon-48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `extension/icons/icon-128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## 2. Icon Design Tips

For the extension icons (16, 48, 128), use only the speech bubble part with the eyes and smile, without the "Micha" text. This will ensure the icon is recognizable at small sizes.

You can use any image editing software to resize the icons:
- **Online Tools**: 
  - https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image
  - https://www.photopea.com (free Photoshop alternative)
- **Desktop Software**: 
  - GIMP (free)
  - Photoshop
  - Preview (Mac) - can do basic resizing

## 3. Verify Integration

After adding the images:
1. Reload the extension in Chrome (`chrome://extensions/`)
2. The icon should appear in the Chrome toolbar
3. The logo should display at the top of the README when viewing on GitHub

## 4. Optional: Create Favicon

You might also want to create a favicon version:
- `extension/icons/favicon.ico` - 16x16 or 32x32 ICO format

This completes the MiCha branding with the friendly chatbot logo! ðŸŽ‰
