# MiCha Logo - Next Steps

## ✅ Completed
- Full MiCha logo saved as `micha-logo.png`
- Icon version saved as `micha-icon.png`
- Favicon created as `micha-icon.ico`
- All extension colors updated to match blue branding (#1E4D7B)

## 📋 Still Needed
To complete the Chrome extension icon setup, you need to create 3 icon sizes from `micha-icon.png`:

1. **icon-16.png** - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
2. **icon-48.png** - 48x48 pixels (extensions page)
3. **icon-128.png** - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## 🛠️ Quick Method
Using an online tool like https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image:
1. Upload `micha-icon.png`
2. Create and save each size:
   - 16x16 → save as `icon-16.png`
   - 48x48 → save as `icon-48.png`
   - 128x128 → save as `icon-128.png`
3. Place all files in `extension/icons/`

Once these are created, the MiCha branding will be complete! 💙
